# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

DriverPass Project Overview
DriverPass wanted a web-based system to address the 65%+ driving test failure rate by providing online practice tests, educational materials, and scheduled driving lessons. The system needed customer registration, appointment scheduling, progress tracking, and DMV integration for updated regulations.

Project Artifacts
Business Requirements Document - Client needs and system requirements
System Design Document - Technical specifications and UML diagrams

Project Reflection 
What I did well: I effectively translated business needs into detailed technical requirements and created comprehensive UML diagrams that clearly illustrated system workflows and user interactions. My documentation bridged the gap between client vision and technical implementation.
What I'd improve: I would enhance the technical requirements with more specific DMV integration details, including API specifications and fallback procedures for system unavailability.
User needs interpretation: I identified distinct user roles (customers, instructors, staff, admins) and designed specific interfaces for each. Considering user needs is crucial because systems must align with real workflows to be successful.
Design approach: I start with stakeholder analysis and requirements gathering, then use UML diagrams to visualize architecture before implementation. Future projects will incorporate more agile methodologies and security-by-design principles.
